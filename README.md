## A deep learning project leveraging the power of CNN's 

# Dog Vision Analysis
Dog breed identification based on the dog image fed into the system.

## üê∂ End-to-end Multi-class Dog Breed Classification

Using Tensorflow models and Google Collab GPU Engines, this project trains a Deep Learning Model on a set of 10,000+ dog images over 120 dog breeds. 
## Outcome:
When provided with an image of a dog, the trained model can deduce the breed of the dog in the image basis varying probabilistic outcomes.
